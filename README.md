# coffee-grinder-predictor

This project is a small educational project for predicting my espresso setting by deep learning.

## My espresso setup

- Lelit Mara X V2 | PL62X 
- TIMEMORE Electric Coffee Grinder Sculptor 78S
- TIMEMORE Basic 2.0 Electronic Espresso Scale with Timer
- Coffee from my local coffee roaster

## Goal of the prediction

1. predict the optimal coffee grinder setting for a 1:2 ratio, grinded coffee to extracted coffee
2. predict the optimal extraction time for that ratio

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.3
